This is an experiment examining how neuroevolution could potentially be used to bring about ethical behaviours in algorithms.

The purpose is to set multiple conflicting goals and use neuroevolution to explore the trade-offs. Goals fall into two types. Task/engineering goals (e.g how quickly can a car get from start to finsh and social/ethical goals (e.g co-operation with other drivers).

To Do
 - [] Give cars ability to vary speeds individually
 - [] Add speed of completion to the task fitness calculation
 - [] Have each car evolve in seperate environments (grid)
 - [] Detect colisions between vehicles
 - [] Create ethical fitness function
 - [] Saving of the network model
 - [] Graph the performance over time
 - [] Try adding mutation of the topology of the networks
